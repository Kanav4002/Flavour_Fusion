Chaat—derived from Indo-Aryan words that literally mean \"tasting with fingertips\" and \"to devour with relish\"—simply means \"snack.\" Papdi chaat can take on many variations, lending itself open to different toppings, condiments, and flavorings. This particular version is a monster of a delight with two chutneys, tender potatoes and chickpeas, tangy yogurt, a medley of eye-catching red onions, pomegranate seeds, diced tomatoes, and finished with a generous snowing of crunchy sev noodles.",
